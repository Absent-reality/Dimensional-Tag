#**Dimensional Tag:**
------------------
An Android port for reading LEGO Dimensions® tags. 

## Disclaimer:
This project was started purely as a "proof of concept", and is in no way endorsed, sponsored or affiliated with the LEGO group.
I am building this project for personal use and, above all else, as a learning tool. The designs are aimed at what I wanted to achieve, thus may not work for everyone. 
Definately a work in progress. Use at your own risk. Music and images are copywrite of their respective brands and companies.

### Use:
!!!*REQUIRES AN NFC CAPABLE DEVICE*!!!!
( Or at least a Lego® Portal and a usb adapter.)
( Currently *does not* support an Xbox one portal. )

This app is really rather user friendly in my opinion. Scroll through each item and tap on them for more info. The search function will direct you to the location of the 
searched for item. At this time each vehicle has a placeholder picture of the first form, and links to the other builds in the popup when they are clicked on. Scan a lego 
character or vehicle tag on the scan page, and it will navigate to the item matching that tag. The app is mostly designed with NTAG213 tags in mind. The portal page 
works in concert with a connected lego portal to turn on and off, and change the color of the leds in the portal. Place a toy tag on the portal pad, and tap the icon when it 
appears to view the items info. Writing is possible from either the nfc device, or the portal, to blank 213 tags. Currently this is only designed for android. I may port it 
over to ios when i feel like paying for it. 


#### Credits:
Thanks to Ellerbach's dimensions project for a lot of the logic and inspiration for this app. 
And to the other peeps I bugged with questions, or various projects that gave me much needed help when I would get stumped on a problem.

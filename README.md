#**Dimensional Tag:**
------------------
An Android port for reading LEGO Dimensions® tags. 

## Disclaimer:
This project was started purely as a "proof of concept", and is in no way endorsed, sponsored or affiliated with the LEGO group.
I am building this project for personal use and, above all else, as a learning tool. The designs are aimed at what I wanted to achieve, thus may not work for everyone. 
Definately a work in progress. Use at your own risk. Music and images are copywrite of their respective brands and companies.

### Use:
!!!*REQUIRES AN NFC CAPABLE DEVICE*!!!!

This app is really rather user friendly in my opinion. Scroll through each item and tap on them for more info. The search function will direct you to the location of the 
searched for item. At this time each vehicle has a placeholder picture of the first form, and links to the other builds in the popup when they are clicked on. 
The app is mostly designed with NTAG213 or 215 tags in mind. Currently this is only designed for android. I may port it over to ios when i feel like paying for it. 


#### Credits:
Thanks to Ellerbach's dimensions project for a lot of the logic and inspiration for this app. 
And to the other peeps I bugged with questions, or various projects that gave me much needed help when I would get stumped on a problem.
